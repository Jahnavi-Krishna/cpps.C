(1)What is an array?
Array names are simply pointers to where the arrays begin in memory, and, of course,
two arrays will always be at different memory locations.
When an array is passed to a general-purpose function designed to handle arrays of
any size, the size of the array must be passed as an additional argument. Furthermore, one
array cannot be assigned to another with the assignment operator(s)—array names are
const pointers, so they cannot be used on the left side of an assignment operator.

pg 217
An array is a group of contiguous memory locations that all have the same type. To refer to
a particular location or element in the array, we specify the array’s name and the position
number of the particular element in the array.

(2)How to declare an array?
Any one of the elements may be referred to by giving the array’s name followed by the position number of
the particular element in square brackets ( [] ). The first element in every array is the zeroth
element. An array name, like other variable names, can contain only letters, digits and
underscores and cannot begin with a digit.
pg.218
eg.All elements of this array
share the array name, c
Position number of the
element within array c
Fig. 6.1 | 12-element array.
c[ 0 ] -45
c[ 1 ] 6
c[ 2 ] 0
c[ 3 ] 72
c[ 4 ] 1543
c[ 5 ] -89
c[ 6 ] 0
c[ 7 ] 62
c[ 8 ] -3
c[ 9 ] 1
c[ 10 ] 6453
c[ 11 ]
The position number within square brackets is called a subscript. A subscript must be
an integer or an integer expression.
