(1)What is an array?
Array names are simply pointers to where the arrays begin in memory, and, of course,
two arrays will always be at different memory locations.
When an array is passed to a general-purpose function designed to handle arrays of
any size, the size of the array must be passed as an additional argument. Furthermore, one
array cannot be assigned to another with the assignment operator(s)â€”array names are
const pointers, so they cannot be used on the left side of an assignment operator.
