(1) WHat are the diffeerent ways to debug a logical error?

1.Comparing with a existing program which works
problem:it is a strategy to learn a prg nd not programming

2. Is mental tracing a good stategy?
problrm:if your understanding of particulara set of concepts may be incomplete,thus u might trace wrong.

3.putting printf where ever possible
-v can find the control flow (whether it is going to if part or else part,like if it goes to the if part,printing "if part" etc)
-values of the variables can be printed
(thereis something called logging in large prgs to debug logical errors.)

4.to debug,compile with the flag -g
gcc -g prgname.c




(2)
int input(int *a,int *b)
{
        printf("Enter a\n");
        scanf("%d",a);
        printf("Enter b\n");
        scanf("%d",b);
}
int compare(int m,int n)
{
        int p;
        if(m=n)
                p=00;
        else
        {
                if(m>n)
                        p=m;
                else if(n>m)
                        p=n;
        }
}
void output(int m,int n,int p)
{
        if(p=00)
                printf("Both are equal");
        else
                printf("%d is greater among %d and %d",&p,&m,&n);
}
int main()
{
}

compare.c: In function ‘output’:
compare.c:27:10: warning: format ‘%d’ expects argument of type ‘int’, but argument 2 has type ‘int *’ [-Wformat=]
   printf("%d is greater among %d and %d",&p,&m,&n);

____used *a,*b,maybe thats wrong
The same error appeared 
___maybe I should ude if(p==00)
Same error again
