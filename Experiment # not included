When # is not written   
E492: Not an editor command: qw! 

The compiler did not compile the code.
so,maybe the compiler starts compiling after reading #

pg42

#include <stdio.h>
is a directive to the C preprocessor. Lines beginning with # are processed by the prepro-
cessor before compilation. Line tells the preprocessor to include the contents of the stan-
dard input/output header ( <stdio.h> ) in the program. This header contains information used by the compiler when compiling calls to standard input/output library functions such
as printf .


pg42
Blank Lines and White Space
if Line is simply a blank line. You use blank lines, space characters and tab characters (i.e.,
“tabs”) to make programs easier to read. Together, these characters are known as white
space. White-space characters are normally ignored by the compiler.

Additional information that blank spaces are used to make the code look simple .But blank spaces are ignored by the compiler.
