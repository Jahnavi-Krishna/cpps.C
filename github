What is Github?
Git is an open-source version control system
So,When developers create something (an app, for example),
they make constant changes to the code,
releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release.
Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. 
This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, 
and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.
